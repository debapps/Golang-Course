		On a dark desert highway,
		Cool wind in my hair.
		Warm smell of collitus,
		Rising up through the air...

		Up ahead in the distance,
		I saw a smearing light,
		My head go heavy and sight go deem,
		I had to stop for the night.

		Welcome to the Hotel California!
		Such a lovely place, such a lovely place,
		Such a Lovely Face!
